## Project Description
Birkenstock and Crocs were founded in 1774 and 2001, respectively. With over 200 years difference, the two shoes have risen in popularity the past few years along with the pandemic and stay-at-home orders. They are both considered ugly, unfashionable, and all together a defiant staple for comfort-seeking customers. 
Our project's core question is whether Crocs or Birkenstocks are close competition. The project will be an observational study of shoe trends in the US. Are there regional differences among the popularity of the two, whether ratings and price vary? We are interested in this question as two members own a pair of ugly shoes and the third is interested in fashion.

## Research Questions
* Where are the best markets for both of these brands?
* Are there seasonal trends in Google searches for the two brands?
* Do we see a difference in ratings among the selling sources?
* Does price impact shoe ratings and reviews?

## Datasets used
* Google Trends
* Google Shopping
