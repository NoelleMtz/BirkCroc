# BirkCroc
Project 1: Brittany Brooks, Kyara Martinez, Noelle Martinez

## Project Description
Our project's core problem is whether Crocs or Birkenstocks occupy the same customer niche in ugly yet comfortable slide-on shoes. The project will be an observational study of shoe trends in the US. Both these shoes are easy slide-ons that are both comfortable and subjectively questionable. Are there regional differences among the popularity of the two, whether customers vary, and if weather impacts sales? We are interested in this question as two members own a pair of ugly shoes and the third is interested in fashion.
